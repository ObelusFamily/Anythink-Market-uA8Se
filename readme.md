# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

Let's installing the dependencies:
- In the main directory run `yarn install`
- cd frontend and run `yarn install`
- cd backend and run `yarn install`

Then return to the main directory, to start the app use: `yarn start`, it'll start both the backend and the frontend.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).
